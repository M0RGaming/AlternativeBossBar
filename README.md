# `A M0R Alternative Boss Bar`

This is a modification to Alternative Boss Bar by BulDeZir, which includes a few personal changes which I preferred over the original.

## Differences

### `Crutch Alerts Integration`
- The addon will not only include mechanics already coded in by BulDeZir, but it will now also draw mechanics from Crutch Alerts.
- As of right now, this forces Crutch Alerts to be a dependancy of A M0R Alternative Boss Bar, but in the future I may make it an optional dependancy

### `Health Numbers`
- Similar to base game, the health bar will now also show the proper health numbers as well as the percent on each of the bosses

### `Mechanic Preview`
- Utilizing the mechanics provided by Crutch Alerts, A M0R Alternative Boss Bar will show upcoming mechanics and their names in the health bar

### Requirements:
- LibAddonMenu2, CrutchAlerts
